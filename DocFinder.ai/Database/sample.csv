These devices remain in class III and require premarket approval, unless and until the device is classified or reclassified into class I or II or FDA issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent, in accordance with section 513(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(i)), to a predicate device that does not require premarket approval. The agency determines whether new devices are substantially equivalent to previously marketed devices by means of premarket notification procedures in section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and Part 807 of the FDA regulations (21 CFR 807). Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This new law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register classifying the device type. In accordance with section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA issued an order on May 24, 2007, automatically classifying the Mandometer in class III, because it was not within a type of device which was introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, nor which was subsequently reclassified into class I or class II. On June 20, 2007, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the Mandometer into class II. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the Mandometer into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request, FDA has determined that the Mandometer indicated for aiding in the treatment of eating disorders by monitoring a patient’s eating rate and providing feedback to the patient on learning normal eating behavior and normal feelings of satiety, can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class II.

Section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This new law provides two options for de novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may, within 30 days of receiving notice of the NSE determination, request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act.

In order to classify the Restiffic Restless Leg Relaxer Foot Wrap into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the de novo request, FDA has determined that the Restiffic Restless Leg Relaxer Foot Wrap intended to reduce symptoms of moderate to severe primary Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) in adults and used during periods of rest or relaxation, when symptoms of RLS occur can be classified in class I. FDA believes that class I (general) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. In addition, this is a prescription device and must comply with 21 CFR 801.109. The nonpowered lower extremity pressure wrap is subject to the general controls of the FD&C Act. Section 510(l) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(l)) provides that a class I device is not subject to the premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act unless the device is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. FDA has determined that the device does not meet these criteria and, therefore, premarket notification is not required for the device.

Section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This new law provides two options for de novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may, within 30 days of receiving notice of the NSE determination, request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device.

On January 23, 2011, FDA received your de novo requesting classification of the Restiffic Restless Leg Relaxer Foot Wrap into class I. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the Restiffic Restless Leg Relaxer Foot Wrap into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the de novo request, FDA has determined that the Restiffic Restless Leg Relaxer Foot Wrap intended to reduce symptoms of moderate to severe primary Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) in adults and used during periods of rest or relaxation, when symptoms of RLS occur can be classified in class I. FDA believes that class I (general) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. In addition, this is a prescription device and must comply with 21 CFR 801.109. The nonpowered lower extremity pressure wrap is subject to the general controls of the FD&C Act. Section 510(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(1)) provides that a class I device is not subject to the premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act unless the device is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.

Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some granted products may instead be combination products. If you have questions on whether your product is a combination product, contact CDRHProductJurisdiction@fda.hhs.gov. FDA concludes that this device should be classified into Class II. This order, therefore, classifies the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase - MM kit, and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type, into Class IT under the generic name Muscular dystrophy newborn screening test. FDA identifies this generic type of device as: Muscular dystrophy newborn screening test. A muscular dystrophy newborn screening test is intended to measure creatine kinase levels obtained from dried blood spot specimens on filter paper from newborns as an aid in screening newborns for muscular dystrophy.

On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On October 11, 2018, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase - MM kit. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase - MM kit into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase - MM kit can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class II. FDA believes that class II (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. The identified risks and mitigation measures associated with the device type are summarized in the following table: Identified Risks to Health Identified Mitigations Risk of False Negative Results Certain design verification and validation activities Certain labeling information Risk of False Positive Results Certain design verification and validation activities Certain labeling information In combination with the general controls of the FD&C Act, the Muscular dystrophy newborn screening test is subject to the following special controls: 1. Design verification and validation must include a clinical validation study that includes the following: (i) Results that demonstrate that the analyte being measured identifies a population of newborns who should be subject to follow up diagnostic testing for the condition being screened. (ii) Predictive value of the device demonstrated using either well characterized prospectively or retrospectively obtained clinical specimens from the intended use population. (iii) Testing performed by device users who are representative of the types of operators intended to use the test.

FDA identifies this generic type of device as: System for detection of microorganisms and antimicrobial resistance using reporter expression. A system for detection of microorganisms and antimicrobial resistance using reporter expression is an in vitro diagnostic device intended for the detection and identification of live microorganisms and the detection of associated antimicrobial drug susceptibility or resistance in specimens from patients at risk of colonization or suspected of infection. Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On March 19, 2019, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of cobas vivoDx MRSA. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify cobas vivoDx MRSA into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, cobas vivoDx can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class II.

Hogan Page 2 Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification.

With HemosIL Apixaban Calibrators, the assay is intended to measure apixaban concentrations in patients on apixaban therapy in the following situations where measurement of apixaban levels could be useful to have as additional information: - Patients at risk for major bleeding - Patients experiencing a bleeding episode U.S. Food & Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire Avenue Silver Spring, MD 20993 www.fda.gov"
148,DEN190032,2022-03-13,2,"DEN190032 - Carol Marble Page 2 The assay is not a stand-alone test and the results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. For use in adult population. For prescription use only. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some granted products may instead be combination products. If you have questions on whether your product is a combination product, contact CDRHProductJurisdiction@fda.hhs.gov. FDA concludes that this device should be classified into Class II. This order, therefore, classifies the HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa, and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type, into Class II under the generic name Direct oral factor Xa inhibitor drug test system. FDA identifies this generic type of device as: Heparin and direct oral factor Xa inhibitor drug test system. A heparin and direct oral factor Xa inhibitor drug test system is intended for the detection of heparin and direct oral factor Xa inhibitors in human specimens collected from patients taking heparin or direct oral factor Xa inhibitors. This device is intended to aid in the management of therapy in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On June 25, 2019, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class II. FDA believes that class II (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. The identified risks and mitigation measures associated with the device type are summarized in the following table:","DEN190032 - Carol Marble Page 2 The assay is not a stand-alone test and the results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.

FDA concludes that this device should be classified into Class II. This order, therefore, classifies the Surfacer Inside-Out Access Catheter System, and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type, into Class II under the generic name Reverse central venous recanalization system. FDA identifies this generic type of device as: Reverse central venous recanalization system. A reverse central venous recanalization system is a prescription device for obtaining central venous access to facilitate catheter insertion into the central venous system. Reverse recanalization involves the initiation of an access path from within the vein and then progressing to the skin for patients with upper body venous occlusions or other conditions that preclude central venous access by other methods.

201,DEN190056,2022-03-05,2,"DEN190056 - Matthew Gee Page 2 FDA concludes that this device should be classified into Class II. This order, therefore, classifies the ADVIA Centaur Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF), and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type, into Class II under the generic name prognostic test for assessment of liver related disease progression. FDA identifies this generic type of device as: Prognostic test for assessment of liver related disease progression. A prognostic test for assessment of liver related disease progression is intended to measure one or more analytes obtained from human samples as an aid in assessing progression of liver related disease. This device is not intended for diagnosis of any disease, for monitoring the effect of any therapeutic product, for assessing progression to hepatocellular carcinoma, or for assessing disease progression in individuals with viral hepatitis. It is also not intended for the detection of viruses, viral antigens, or antibodies to viruses. Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On December 26, 2019, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the ADVIA Centaur Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF). The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act.

This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device.

FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On February 13, 2020, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the ClearUP Sinus Relief. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the ClearUP Sinus Relief into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the ClearUP Sinus Relief can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class I. FDA believes that class II (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. The identified risks and mitigation measures associated with the device type are summarized in the following table: Table 1 — Identified Risks to Health and Mitigation Measures Injury from electrical current on face causing Non-clinical performance testing one or more of the following: Human factors testing e Skin burn Software verification, validation, and hazard analysis e Skin redness Electrical safety testing e Skin irritation Electromagnetic compatibility testing e Facial muscle twitching Battery safety testing e Electrical shock Labeling e Pain e Headache e Discomfort or muscle twitching of the eye Nerve and muscle injury Non-clinical performance testing Electrical safety testing Software verification, validation, and hazard analysis congestion In combination with the general controls of the FD&C Act, the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator for the relief of congestion is subject to the following special controls: 1.

Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On March 19, 2020, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the Q-Collar. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the Q-Collar into class I or II, it 1s necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the Q-Collar can be classified in class I with the establishment of special controls for class II. FDA believes that class I (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. The identified risks to health are syncope due to excessive compression, use error, interference with other equipment, or ineffective treatment leading to impact-related trauma or injury, and adverse tissue reaction. The identified risks and mitigation measures associated with the device type are summarized in the following table: Identified Risks to Health Mitigation Measures Use error, interference with other Human factors testing equipment, or ineffective treatment Labeling leading to impact-related trauma or injury In combination with the general controls of the FD&C Act, the External compression device for internal jugular vein compression is subject to the following special controls:"

A warning that serious harm can result from persistent, excessive pressure on the neck due to incorrect device size and fit. v. A warning that the device has not been demonstrated to prevent long-term cognitive function deficits, and the ultimate impact on clinical outcomes has not been evaluated. Section 510(m) of the FD&C Act provides that FDA may exempt a class II device from the premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, if FDA determines that premarket notification is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. FDA has determined premarket notification is necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type and, therefore, the device is not exempt from the premarket notification requirements of the FD&C Act.

Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification.

IPL is to be applied only to skin on the malar region of the face, from tragus to tragus including the nose (eyes should be fully covered by protective eyewear). IPL 1s intended to be applied as an adjunct to other modalities, such as meibomian gland expression, artificial tear lubricants and warm compresses. FDA concludes that this device should be classified into Class II. This order, therefore, classifies the Lumenis Stellar M22, and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type, into Class II under the generic name Device for the application of indirect heat for managing dry eye. FDA identifies this generic type of device as: Intense pulsed light (IPL) device for managing dry eye. An intense pulsed light device for managing dry eye is a prescription device intended for use in the application of intense pulsed light therapy to the skin. The device is used in patients with dry eye disease due to meibomian gland dysfunction, also known as evaporative dry eye or lipid deficiency dry eye.

This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On April 20, 2020, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the Lumenis Stellar M22. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the Lumenis Stellar M22 into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request and provided additional information, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the Lumenis Stellar M22 can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class II. FDA believes that class II (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. The identified risks and mitigation measures associated with the device type are summarized in the following table: Table 1 – Identified Risks to Health and Mitigation Measures Identified Risks to Health Mitigation Measures Tissue damage due to Thermal safety assessment overheating Software verification, validation, and hazard analysis Labeling Tissue damage or loss of vision Clinical performance testing due to light radiation Labeling Adverse tissue reaction Biocompatibility evaluation Electrical shock or burn Thermal safety assessment Electrical safety testing Software verification, validation, and hazard analysis Labeling Interference with other devices Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing Software verification, validation, and hazard analysis Labeling Pain or discomfort Clinical performance testing Labeling Failure to mitigate dry eye signs Clinical performance testing and/or symptoms Labeling U.S. Food & Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire Avenue Doc ID# 04017.04.22 Silver Spring, MD 20993 www.fda.gov","DEN200028 — Ms. Shlomit Segman Page 2 Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012.

264,DEN200030,2022-03-05,2,"DEN200030 - Niels Festjens Page 2 FDA identifies this generic type of device as: Interventional cardiovascular implant simulation software device. An interventional cardiovascular implant simulation software device is a prescription device that provides a computer simulation of an interventional cardiovascular implant device inside a patient’s cardiovascular anatomy. It performs computational modeling to predict the interaction of the interventional cardiovascular implant device with the patient-specific anatomical environment. Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification.

The detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of respiratory infection is indicative of the presence of the identified microorganism and aids in the diagnosis of respiratory infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that are not detected by this test, or lower respiratory tract infection that may not be detected by an NPS specimen. Positive results do not rule out coinfection with other organisms. The agent(s) detected by the BioFire RP2.1 may not be the definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract infection.

270,DEN200031,2022-03-05,3,,"DEN200031 - Kristen Kanack Page 3 Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On May 19, 2020, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1). The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class II. FDA believes that class II (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. The identified risks and mitigation measures associated with the device type are summarized in the following table: Identified Risks to Health Mitigation Measures Risk of an inaccurate test Certain labeling information, including limitations, warnings, result (false positive or false | device descriptions, explanation of procedures, and performance negative result) leading to information identified in special controls (1), (3), (5), and (6). improper patient Use of certain specimen collection devices identified in special management control (2).

This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On May 27, 2020, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the NightWare Kit. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act.

This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device.

318,DEN200059,2022-03-06,2,"DEN200059 - Joanne Totosy De Zepetnek Page 2 FDA concludes that this device should be classified into Class II. This order, therefore, classifies the POMC/PCSK1/LEPR CDx Panel, and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type, into Class II under the generic name setmelanotide eligibility gene variant detection system. FDA identifies this generic type of device as: Setmelanotide eligibility gene variant detection system. A setmelanotide eligibility gene variant detection system is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic device intended to detect germline variants within genes isolated from human specimens for the purpose of identifying patients with obesity who may benefit from treatment with setmelanotide in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling. Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On September 18, 2020, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the POMC/PCSK1/LEPR CDx Panel. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the POMC/PCSK1/LEPR CDx Panel into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request, in response to our request for additional information letter dated December 2, 2020, and during interactive review, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the POMC/PCSK1/LEPR CDx Panel can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class II. FDA believes that class II (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. The identified risks to health are risks associated with incorrect performance of the test and incorrect interpretation of genetic data leading to false positive or false negative results. The identified risks and mitigation measures associated with the device type are summarized in the following table: Identified Risks to Health Mitigation Measures Incorrect performance of the test leading to  Certain design verification and validation false positive results (causing patients to activities, including documentation of receive drug treatment inappropriately) or false certain studies. negative results (causing patients to miss an  Certain labeling information, including opportunity for drug treatment) certain limiting statements and performance information.","DEN200059 - Joanne Totosy De Zepetnek Page 2 FDA concludes that this device should be classified into Class II.

The kinematic data provided by the device are used as an adjunct to other physiological parameter measurement tools utilized during the course of patient monitoring and treatment post-surgery. Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device.

A software algorithm device to assist users in digital pathology is an in vitro diagnostic device intended to evaluate acquired scanned pathology whole slide images. The device uses software algorithms to provide information to the user about presence, location, and characteristics of areas of the image with clinical implications. Information from this device is intended to assist the user in determining a pathology diagnosis. Section 513(f)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) on July 9, 2012. This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device.

First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification. On March 1, 2021, FDA received your De Novo requesting classification of the Luminopia One. The request was submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. In order to classify the Luminopia One into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the Luminopia One can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class Il. FDA believes that class II (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type. The identified risks and mitigation measures associated with the device type are summarized in the following table: Adverse events due to device treatment (e.g., Clinical performance testing headache, new or worsening heterotropia, Labeling worsened vision in either eye, eye strain, eye twitching, facial redness, increased night terrors, thermal injury, dizziness, seizure, nausea, or double vision) Ineffective treatment leading to worsening of Clinical performance testing condition Software verification, validation, and hazard analysis Labeling delay of treatment Labeling Software malfunction leading to delay of Software verification, validation, and hazard treatment analysis Labeling"

The ONE Male Condom should be used with a condom compatible lubricant when used for anal intercourse. FDA concludes that this device should be classified into Class II. This order, therefore, classifies the ONE Male Condom, and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type, into Class II under the generic name external condom for anal intercourse or vaginal intercourse. FDA identifies this generic type of device as: External condom for anal intercourse or vaginal intercourse. An external condom for anal intercourse or vaginal intercourse is a barrier device which covers the penis and 1s used to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (when used for anal intercourse or vaginal intercourse) and for contraception (when used for vaginal intercourse). This classification does not include condoms intended for vaginal intercourse only. U.S. Food & Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire Avenue Silver Spring, MD 20993 www.fda.gov"

This law provides two options for De Novo classification. First, any person who receives a ""not substantially equivalent"" (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) for a device that has not been previously classified under the Act may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act. On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act removed a requirement that a De Novo request be submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination. Alternatively, any person who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k). FDA shall, within 120 days of receiving such a request, classify the device. This classification shall be the initial classification of the device. Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying the device, FDA must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the classification.

In order to classify the ONE Male Condom into class I or II, it is necessary that the proposed class have sufficient regulatory controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After review of the information submitted in the De Novo request, FDA has determined that, for the previously stated indications for use, the ONE Male Condom can be classified in class II with the establishment of special controls for class II. FDA believes that class II (special) controls provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device type.

The device is 50 cm long, and its oval cross section increases progressively over its length from 3.0 x 1.5 mm to 3.0 mm x 6.0 mm. The spacer slope is designed to match shapes and dimensions of the digital canal. The spacers are made of high performance medical grade silicone elastomer containing barium sulfate to provide radio-opacity. During the first stage of the reconstruction surgery, the spacer is placed into the reconstructed tendon bed and slid until optimum fit is achieved. The tendon is attached to the distal phalanx and the proximal spacer end is left free in the paim or forelimb. Excess spacer material is cut off. The second stage of surgery is performed 2 to 6 months later, once an appropriate pseudo-sheath has been created around the spacer, and tissues are soft and pliable. The spacer is then removed and replaced | by a permanent active tendon autograft. The device is not intended as permanent impiant or to function as a replacement for a ligament or tendon. indication for use: Scarred or adhering tendons due to trauma or failed primary repair. Absence of tendon sheath. Scarred or adherent non-functional tendon pulleys. Ruptured tendon. Technological characteristics: The Single Size Tendon Spacer device has the equivalent technological characteristics {i.e. chemical composition, and mechanical strength) to the predicate device. Performance data: Studies demonstrated that the Single Size Tendon Spacer devices have the equivalent mechanical strength and biocompatibility performances to the predicate device.

The Silent Night V was evaluated in the clinical setting in comparison to the legally marketed SensorMedics 4000 Series sleep system (K915856), Device Description: The Silent Night V is a portable, IIne-powered ventilatory effort recorder, intended for use in the home for the diagnostic evaluation of sleep disorders. The device consists of a bedside unit with a cable that runs to a patient module which is positioned on the patients arm. The sensors are positioned on the patient's body and connect into the patient module. The Silent Night V contains the sume functions as its predecessor, Silent Night IL, with the addition of two other functions, The functionality of Silent Night V has been expanded from the previous generation device, (Silent Night II - K981034) to include blood oxygen saturation level, pulse rate, and respiratory effort monitoring, The Silent Night V provides the following data: ° Arterial oxygen saturation level (SP0Q2) e Pulse rate « Respiration effort signal . | e Airflow waveform corrected for ambient room noise Throughout a typical sleep study, sleep-disordered breathing information and statistics are stored into the memory. The stored ‘nformation includes time and duration of apneas and hypopneas, blood oxygen saturation levels, pulse rate, respiratory effort level. sound intensity level, epoch numbers and paused time ‘ntervals. Current storage capacity is 512 Kbytes, which is adequate to retain three 8-hour sleep studies. Software has been developed to retrieve, score, display and priat the collected data on a personal computer platform. A summary report and un event log can be provided to the physician to view the sleep data. | Intended Use: The Silent Night V is indicated for use in the diagnostic evaluation of adults with possible | sleep apnea.

The device is in compliance with IEC 60601-1 and IEC 801-X (for mechanical and environmental stresses) standards. Clinical data - Silent Night V was evaluated in the clinical setting. Patients underwent a slecp laboratory evaluation with a standard polysomnograph. Silent Night V was used concomitandy for a side-by-side comparison, The number of apneas, hypopneas and the resulting Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDJ) calculated by the Silent Night V was compared with the data gathered simultaneously by the standard polysomnograph. The data were compared on an event-by-cvent basis. The RDI scores were determined and compared with the RDI score from the PSG using the Pearson r. The correlation coefficient between the PSG and the Silent Night V was 97.7%. Using the total number of apneas us the basis for calculation, the sensitivity between the two devices for apnea detection was 83.2% and the number of false positive events per hour was 3.5 (# of false positive apneas per hour). Using the total number of events (apneas und hypopneas) as the basis for calculation, the overall scnsitivity was 90.7% and the number of false positive events per hour was 3.8. | The definition for RDI is the total number of apneas and hypopneas, divided by the study duration (in hours). For RDI, using the overall number of patients as the basis of calculation, and a cut-off of RDI=15, the Silent Night V achicved a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 91% when compared to the PSG. The results of the clinical study demonstrated the performance of the Silent Night V in detecting | disordered breathing events, which can be indicative of sleep apnea. In view of the noninvasive, user- fricndly design and simple operational features of the device, the Silent Night V offers potential benefit as a cost effective home use device for the evaluation of patients with possible sleep disorders. Conclusion: The information and data, provided in this 510(k) notification established that the Silent Night V is substantially equivalent to legally marketed predicate devices.

Vice President, Regulatory and Clinical Affairs DATE SUMMARY PREPARED: January 31, 2000 TRADE NAME: WaveScan™ Wavefront System Model HS 1 COMMON NAME: Autorefractor SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO: The WaveScan™ Wavefront System Model HS 1 is substantially equivalent to the . predicate device, the Canon R-50m. Both devices have the same indication for use, in that they are devices which are diagnostic tools for obtaining objective ; output measurements of refractive error of the eye. These devices obtain this information by means of light ray deflection principles to measure the refractive - elements of the eye and provide automated read-outs of refractive error. The principle of light waves incorporates the known elements of light energy moving in successive flat sheets, or wavefronts. The measurement principles of both instruments utilize the element of wavefront measurements from the refractive elements of the eye, the lens and cornea as light interference changes the wavefront as affected by these elements. Each instrument utilize condensing lenses within the body of the instrument, and a fogging technique which blurs a fixation target for the patient who is being measured. The output measures for each instrument consist of the spherical, cylindrical and axis of the subject’s refractive error which are provided in a printed read-out format.. OC00e7"
411,K000327,2022-03-23,2,,"DESCRIPTION of the DEVICE: The WaveScan™ Wavefront System Model HS 1 autorefractor device is a diagnostic instrument designed to measure refractive error of the eye automatically by use of wavefront technology. Light travels in a procession of flat sheets known as wavefronts. As these wavefronts pass through an imperfect refractive medium including the cornea and the lens, the aberrations which are created by the irregular surfaces “wrinkle” the light rays and create wavefront errors or distortions. The instrument contains tiny sensors which measure the gradient, or slope, of the wavefront which emanate from the eye. After light travels through the eye’s optical system and out again, the sensors accurately detect slight variations of wavefront irregularities as they exit the eye. The sensors then provide additional information within the confines of the instrument through a series of lenses and apertures which are subject to mathematical algorithms and software. Once analyzed by the computer, a refractive error read-out is provided to the user. This analysis is made from multiple points of light which precisely pinpoint variations in refractive status across the entire entrance pupi! of the eye. This allows for the high level of accuracy of the instrument thus providing the user with very precise readings of refractive error. : INDICATIONS FOR USE: The VISX WaveScan™ System Model HS | is a diagnostic instrument indicated for the automated measurement and analysis of refractive errors of the eye including hyperopia and myopia from +6.00 to -8.00 diopters spherical, and astigmatism from 0.00 to -6.00 diopters. — SPECIFICATIONS OF THE DEVICE: pT VISXWaveScan No Specification 110/120V, 50/60Hz - Requirements .

412,K000327,2022-03-23,3,,"TESTING OF THE DEVICE: Companison testing was conducted under a protocol designed to demonstrate the equivalence of the WaveScan™ Wavefront Model HS 1 to the Canon Model R-50m autorefractor. These devices which are basically equivalent, measure refractive error of the eye automatically by use of scanning light deflection through the optics of the eye. The near infrared light acts as a secondary light source reflected off the back of the eye at the retina. The emerging light passes through the optics of the lens and cornea and is affected by a series of apertures and lenses which are then systematically analyzed through mathematical models and reveal the measurement of refractive error. The tests were conducted using a model test eye developed by VISX, Inc. and modeled after the Gullstrand Standard Test Eye Model established for ; bench testing in the ophthalmic community. Tests were conducted across a range of refractive errors including myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatic errors of refraction at various angles and orientations. Combinations of myopic and hyperopic astigmatism were employed. Each of these test conditions was repeated five times in each instrument, and subject to statistical analysis. The results indicated that the WaveScan™, Wavefront System performed within statistical 95% level of confidence in all parameters measured and was equivalent or superior to the control instrument in accuracy and repeatability. Overall, the WaveScan device provided estimates of refractive error with less variability than the control device as seen in the data, from standard deviation estimates. LABELING The WaveScan™ Wavefront System Model HS | is provided to the user with a User Manual of Operator’s Instructions. The device is a diagnostic tool used by professionals and ancillary personnel in the determination of preliminary diagnostic refractive error information.

Box 587 Warsaw, Indiana 46581-0587 Proprietary Name: Mallory-Head Modular Calcar Total Hip Common or Usual Name: Metallic total hip system Classification Name: Prosthesis, hip, semi-constrained, metal/polymer, porous uncemented (888.3358); Prosthesis, hip, semi-constrained, metal/polymer, Cemented (888.3350) Device Classification: Class II Device Product Code: 8&7LPH; 87JDI Device Description: The predicate Mallory-Head Modular Calcar was originally cleared in K945115 for non-cemented use. The distal stem has been modified by applying a roll-hardened/machined process to the male portion of the Morse locking taper that joins the proximal and distal portions of the stem. The predicate and modified devices are made of the same and have the same surface finishes | and indications for use as well as the same lengths and configurations. These modified distal stems are interchangeable with all of Biomet’s modular hip systems. As with the predicate, the proximal body and the distal stem are joined by means of a Morse locking taper. Indications For Use: 1) Noninflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis; 2) rheumatoid arthritis; 3) correction of functional deformity; 4) treatment of non-union, femoral neck fracture, and trochanteric fractures of the proximal femur with head involvement, unmanageable using other techniques; 5) revision of previously failed total hip arthroplasty due to recurrent dislocations. Potential Risks: 1) Material sensitivity reactions. Implantation of foreign material in tissues can result in histological reactions involving various sizes of macrophages and fibroblasts. The clinical significance of this effect is uncertain, as similar changes may occur as a precursor to or during the healing process. Particulate wear debris and discoloration from metallic and polyethylene components of joint implants may be present in adjacent tissue or fluid. It has been reported that wear debris may initiate cellular response resulting in osteolysis or osteolysis may be a result of loosening of the implant. 2) Early or late postoperative, infection, and allergic reaction."
417,K000335,2022-03-23,2,,"| COO 35 x fore” 3) Intraoperative bone perforation or fracture may occur, particularly in the presence of poor bone stock caused by osteoporosis, bone defects from previous surgery, bone resorption, or while inserting the device. 4) Loosening or migration of the implants can occur due to loss of fixation, trauma, malalignment, bone resorption, excessive activity. 5) Periarticular calcification or osseification, with or without impediment of joint mobility. 6) Inadequate range of motion due to improper selection or positioning of components. 7) Undesirable shortening of limb. 8) Dislocation and subluxation due to inadequate fixation and improper positioning. Muscle and fibrous tissue laxity can also contribute to these conditions. 9) Fatigue fracture of component can occur as a result of loss of fixation, strenuous activity, malalignment, trauma, non-union, or excessive weight. 10) Fretting and crevice corrosion can occur at interfaces between components. 11) Wear and/or deformation of articulating surfaces. 12) Trochanteric avulsion or non-unioi: as a result of excess muscular tension, early weight bearing or inadequate reattachment. 13) Problems of the knee or ankle of the affected limb or contralateral limb aggravated by leg length discrepancy, too much femoral medialization or muscle deficiencies. . 14) Postoperative bone fracture and pain."

Bone formation occurs in apposition to the calcium phosphate surface and within the interstices of the implant skeleton. As the implant resorbs, bone and soft tissue grow into the space previously occupied by the calcium carbonate. INDICATIONS FOR USE Pro Osteon 2008 Resorbable Bone Graft Substitute is indicated only for bony voids or gaps that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. Pro Osteon 2008 is indicated to be gently packed into bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system (i.e., the extremities, spine and pelvis). These defects may be surgically created osseous defects or osseous defects created from traumatic injury to the bone. The product provides a bone graft substitute that resorbs and is replaced with bone during the healing process. CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS AND COMPLICATIONS 1. Contraindications Pro Osteon 2008 is contraindicated for fractures of the growth plate; for segmental defects; for indications which may be subjected to excessive impact or stresses; when there is significant vascular impairment proximal to the graft site; when there are metabolic or systemic disorders that affect bone or wound healing; when stabilization of the fracture is not possible; in cases where intraoperative soft tissue coverage is not planned or possible, and in infected sites. 2. Warnings and Precautions Pro Osteon 2008 does not possess sufficient mechanical strength to support reduction of a defect site prior to soft and hard tissue ingrowth. Rigid fixation techniques are recommended as needed to assure rigid stabilization of the defect in all planes. Pro Osteon 2008 Resorbable Bone Graft Substitute is intended for use by surgeons familiar with bone grafting and rigid fixation techniques. Complete postoperative wound closure is essential. Pro Osteon 2008 is radiopaque until resorbed. Radiopacity may mask underlying pathological conditions. Radiopacity may also make it difficult to radiographically assess the ingrowth of new bone.

Shelf Life: The BOSTON XO (hexafocon A) is a hydrophobic rigid gas permeable contact lens material with <1% water content. This material will be shipped dry. The data presented supports substantial equivalence of this BOSTON XO (hexafocon A) contact lens material to the already marketed BOSTON ES (enflufocon A) contact lens material. Based on the Premarket Notification Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses, May 12, 1994, shelf-life studies are not required for clearance of this material. 210"
503,K000795,2022-03-24,3,"510(k) Premarket Notification BOSTON XO Contact Lens Material Solution Compatibility: Studies were conducted on blue tinted lens material with the ultraviolet light absorber. Lenses were run through 30 cycles of cleaning and conditioning to establish the compatibility of the lens material with the recommended care regimen. The parameters of ultraviolet and visible light (UVlvis) spectra, base curve, lens diameter, power and surface quality were recorded prior to and upon completion of 30 cycles. Initial and final data were compared. There were no significant changes to lens parameters after 30 complete cycles. Clinical Testing Below is a summary of the clinical study carried out to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the BOSTON XO (hexafocon A) contact lens material when used as a daily wear contact lens for the correction of visual acuity. A total of 128 eyes (64 patients) were entered into the study by 3 Investigators. Prior to entry into this study each patient was required to read and sign a Statement of Informed Consent. All patients who signed a Statement of Informed Consent are accounted for in this report. Of the 128 eyes (64 patients enrolled), 102 eyes (51 patients) completed the study. The safety and efficacy measures for this study were: Safety: Adverse Events, Positive Slit Lamp Findings, Symptoms/Complaints and Keratometry Changes Efficacy: Refractive Changes, Lens Visual Acuity, Lens VA Line Changes, Lens Deposits, and Lens Wettability. The sponsor concludes that BOSTON XO (hexafocon A) contact lens material is equivalent in safety and efficacy to the predicate device, Boston ES (enflufocon A). 8.

A. Applicant Information e Submitter: Allergy Technology Ltd., Hankerton Field Farm, Crudwell Road, Malmesbury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom © Contact: Wharton Shober, D.Sc., Chairman, Telephone: 001-44-1666-577- 082, Facsimile: 011-44-1666-577-942, E-mail: Zacharias@btinternet.com © Summary Date: March 28, 2000, revised December 3, 2001 B. Device Name and Classification e Proprietary Name: Z-Net mattress and pillow covers © Common or Usual Name: Allergy control mattress and pillow covers e Classification Name: Mattress cover for medical purposes (per 21 CFR § 880.6190) e Predicate Device: Allergy Control Covers (K903382) and other mattress covers classified under 21 CFR § 880.6190. C. Device Description The Z-Net allergy control device consists of a mattress cover and pillow cover created from polyester impregnated with permethrin. The treated fabric reduces the levels of house dust mites (HDM) and their allergens in the mattress and pillow which, in turn, provides relief to individuals suffering from atopic allergies. | D. Intended Use | Z-Net reduces for up to 15 months house dust mites and their allergens in bedding, a leading cause of allergenic rhinitis, allergenic asthma, and allergenic eczema. Reductions are based on comparisons with untreated bed covers. E. Comparison to Predicate Device The primary difference between the Z-Net and Allergy Control covers (and similar mattress covers) relates to the mechanism used by each device to reduce HDM allergens in bedding. The Allergy Control covers protect individuals from exposure to HDM allergens by trapping both the dust mites and the allergens within the covers. The"
521,K001003,2022-03-07,2,,"covers are made of a finely-weaved, semi-permeable fabric, with pore openings significantly smaller than the dust mites or allergens. The device is designed to place between the allergens and the user a barrier through which neither the allergens nor the . dust mites can pass. The reduction in exposure is usually short term but can be extended with regular washing of the product. Rather than placing a barrier between the user and the HDM allergens, the Z-Net covers are treated with permethrin that kills the dust mites and eliminates the production of new allergens. Users are initially exposed to existing allergens, but over time, the allergens break down or migrate away from the mattress and pillow. This provides long term relief from HDM allergens without washing. In addition, whereas the Z-Net mattress cover only covers the top and sides of the mattress, the Allergy Control cover encases the entire mattress, top and bottom. The Z-Net fabric is broadly weaved and is 100 percent polyester. The Allergy Control cover is made of a finely-weaved, semi- permeable, cotton-polyester blend fabric. Finally, the Z-Net is not supposed to be washed, whereas the Allergy Control covers require regular washing. F. Performance Data | The effectiveness of the Z-Net cover.was established primarily through testing conducted at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). The two- year, double-blind study was undertaken to determine whether a permethrin-impregnated mattress liner, placed on a mattress without further maintenance, achieved significant long-term reduction of HDMs and their allergens in mattresses. The LSHTM laboratory conducted a pre-intervention analysis of dust samples to confirm that the test and placebo groups were comparable prior to intervention. Dust samples were then collected one month post-intervention, using standardized sampling methods. Thereafter, samples were collected at two months, five months, fifteen months, and twenty-four months. The — results of the test confirmed that the use of permethrin-impregnated mattress covers reduces HDMs in bedding. The effectiveness of the Z-Net cover was further established by supplemental documentation relating to the LSHTM study. In addition, many studies were provided demonstrating that a reduction of HDMs in bedding offers relief to sufferers of atopic allergies by reducing their exposure to HDM allergens. Numerous studies were also submitted to establish the stability of permethrin in fabrics. In particular, reference was made to permethrin’s drug master file on file with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which establishes the stability of the active : ingredient under various storage conditions. Additionally, studies demonstrating the | persistence of permethrin in fabrics after rinsing, washing, and exposure to weather and detergent were provided. The safety of the device was established through direct biocompatability testing of the end product and through reports of various biocompatability reviews of permethrin conducted by the FDA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Military. The reports confirmed that permethrin has been safely used in topical drug treatments approved by FDA. In addition, EPA has registered technical grades of : 2 C:ATEMP13JL@011.doc"
522,K001003,2022-03-07,3,,"permethrin for use in household articles including mattresses and upholstered furniture, as well as in military uniforms — all of which will come into direct contact with the skin. Because permethrin has been used in military uniforms, it has been confirmed as safe by numerous U.S. Military studies. In particular, permethrin is not acutely or subchronically toxic; does not cause skin irritation or sensitization; and is not neurotoxic, immunotoxic, organ toxic, reproductive or developmentally toxic, or carcinogenic. The FDA, EPA, and _ US. Military have all concurred with the general literature in finding permethrin to be safe for use in impregnated fabrics. G. Summary The safety and effectiveness data submitted to FDA establishes that Z-Net is safe and effective for its intended use and is substantially equivalent to applicable predicate devices. 3 CATEMP3JL@01!.doc"

Intended Use The RadioMed™ Source with activities from 0.1 to 5.0 mCi per centimeter length is indicated for temporary or permanent interstitial implantation or surface application to treat selected localized tumors. They can be used as either primary treatment or as treatment for residual disease after excision of primary or recurrent tumors. The RadioMed™ Source may be used concurrently with or following treatment with other interventions, such as external beam therapy, hyperthermia, or chemotherapy. Tumors of the head, neck, lung, pancreas, prostate and other accessible tumors are commonly treated. 6. Comparison of Technological Characteristics The design of each of the predicates and the RadioMed™ Source is a sealed source from which to deliver a therapeutic dosage of radioactive energy. The predicate devices use a sealed source in a ""can"" configuration, often referred to as a seed. The RadioMed™ Source is a sealed source in the form of a wire.

The valve is surgically placed ina subcutaneous pocket. The cannula, placed into an internal jugular or subclavian vein, is connected to the valve by means of the barbed connector on the valve stem. Vascular access can be achieved by accessing the valve with a needle. Accessories to the LifeSite Hemodialysis Access System, including a | tunneler, introducer and Medisystems needle, will be packaged with the system and sold as a unit. Another accessory, the LifeSite Hemodialysis Cannula Exchange Kit will be sold separately. LifeSite Hemodialysis Access System 510(k) Submission SS renenonnefil | | 143"

A 70% isopropyl alcohol solution is used in conjunction with the LifeSite System for the localized cleansing of the injection site, valve pocket, and LifeSite valve. E, Technological Characteristics/Performance Data Summary The ""510(k) Substantial Equivalence Decision-Making Process (Detailed)"" decision tree (CDRH 510(k) Manual 92-4158) was utilized in conjunction with the technological characteristics and performance testing results to make a determination of substantial equivalence as follows: 1. Does New Device Have Same Indication Statements? —- | No. While there are some differences in their specific indication , | statements, the LifeSite System and Tesio-Cath device have the same intended use. Both devices are intended for blood access for hemodialysis. The LifeSite System has a more narrow indication. The BardPort device also has the same intended use, for blood access. However, the BardPort device has the more specific indication of use for blood sampling and drug administration. | 2. Do the Differences Alter the Intended Therapeutic/Diagnostic/ete. Effect? No. As stated previously, all three devices are intended to be used for blood access. In addition, both the LifeSite System and Tesio-Cath device are intended to be used for hemodialysis. 3. Does New Device Have Same Technological Characteristics, e.g., Design, Materials, etc.? No. Although there are some similarities, there are several technological characteristics which are different. For example, the mechanism to prevent blood flow when not in use is different for each device. There are | . also differences in physical dimensions. ."
614,K001633,2022-03-24,3,,"Kovié33 . PAGE 3 6-4 — 4, Could the New Characteristics Affect Safety or Effectiveness? Yes. Changes to the mechanism to prevent blood flow could affect the ability of the device to prevent a leak. Physical changes may affect flow rate and other basic mechanical properties of the device, such as connection strength. 5. Do the New Characteristics Raise New Types of Safety or Effectiveness Questions? No. The types of safety and effectiveness questions remain the same. | Ability to prevent leaks, provide adequate flow rates, and maintain high connection strength between the cannula and valve (for valve/port type | devices) are safety and effectiveness concerns common to all blood access devices. | 6. Do Accepted Scientific Methods Exist for Assessing Effects of the New Characteristics? Yes. The International Standards Organization has developed testing methods for assessing intravascular catheters and central venous - | catheters. The FDA has a guidance document outlining the testing to : evaluate implanted infusion ports. These documents provide standard | scientific methods for assessing the effects of the new characteristics on | the device performance issues noted above. | 7. Are Performance Data Available to Assess Equivalence? Yes. The LifeSite System was tested for safety and effectiveness. In Vitro tests were chosen and developed based on the October, 1990 FDA | document “Guidance on 510(k) Submissions for Implanted Infusion Ports” and Parts | and 3 of the international standard ISO10555, “Sterile, _ single-use, intravascular catheters.” Where appropriate, comparative ~ testing was done using the Tesio-Cath device or a BardPort device; the devices used for comparison were chosen based on the presence of predicate design features relevant to the test. In addition, a prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical tral comparing efficacy of the Vasca LifeSite Hemodialysis Access System (as used with the cleansing solution, Clorpactin) to that of the Medcomp Tesio-Cath device was conducted.

Do Performance Data Demonstrate Equivalence? Yes. The performance of the LifeSite System was found to meet all clinically relevant acceptance criteria and was therefore acceptable. Where comparative testing was conducted, the LifeSite System performance was equivalent to or better than that of the relevant predicate device in every case or was acceptable based on clinically relevant criteria.

Preamendment: Norland Model 178 Bone Densitometer Intended Use: An aid to the physician in determiming fracture . risk. Device Description : The CTXA Hip Bone Mineral Densitometer (CTXA Hip) is a software package intended for estimation of bone mineral content (BMC), in grams, and bone mineral density (BMD), in g/cm’, of the proximal femur. The CTXA Hip uses quantitative computed tomography (QCT) methods to derive bone mass and bone density estimates from 3D CT image data sets. The CTXA Hip is"
686,K002113,2022-03-07,2,,"intended to be used with compatible, whole-body CT scanners and with compatible CT calibration phantoms. BMD estimates are derived in units of g/cm* equivalent K2HPO, density. Intended Use The CTXA Hip Bone Mineral Densitometer is intended to estimate bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the proximal femur. The BMD estimates can be compared with CTXA Hip-derived reference data. T-scores are calculated with respect to CTXA Hip young normal female reference data, and the T-scores can be used by the physician as an aid in determining fracture risk. Summary of Technological Characteristics and Comparison with Predicate Devices The CTXA Hip Bone Mineral Densitometer Module (CTXA Hip) provides estimates of bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) values smilar to those obtained from the predicate DXA devices (K883280: Hologic QDR 1000 X-Ray Bone Densitometer, K 943505: Hologic QDR 3000 X-Ray Bone Densitometer) for regions of interest in the proximal femur. CTXA Hip uses the same technical procedures to acquire and calibrate CT image data as are used for the predicate device K894854: QCT Bone Mineral Density Analysis Software. CTXA Hip reference data for young normal US Caucasian females were acquired in a clinical study so that patient results obtained using CTXA Hip can be compared to this normal reference population. The CTXA Hip BMD estimates compared to the CTXA Hip reference population are used as an aid to the physician in identifying patients with low bone mineral density. Additionally, normal data comparisons provide a basis for estimating fracture risk, as ts done with the predicate preamendment device Norland Model 178 Bone Densitometer. BMC and BMD estimates are returned by the CTXA Hip for the following proximal femur regions-of-interest (ROIs): (1) femoral neck, (2) trochanter, (3) intertrochanter, (4) Ward's Triangle, and (5) total hip (i.c., superposition of ROIs 1-3). Summary of Non-Clinical Performance Data In vitro phantom studies with the CTXA Hip indicate a device precision of approximately 0.007 g/cm? across a variety of CT scanners. These tests also indicate that in vitro CTXA Hip BMD estimates are unbiased when expressed as equivalent K2HPO4 mineral density. Summary of Clinical Performance Data CTXA Hip clinical studies indicate a long term in vivo device precision of 0.011 g/cm for total hip and 0.012 g/cm? for femoral neck regions of interest. Clinical studies were done comparing BMD results from CTXA Hip with results from Hologic QDR 1000 and QDR4500 bone densitometers. BMD correlations (Pearson's R) were 0.90-0.97 for the Total Hip region of interest and 0.88-0.95 for the Femoral Neck region of interest. A clinical study was done to collect a set of young normal female reference data for calculation of T-scores for CTXA Hip results. Conclusions"
687,K002113,2022-03-07,3,,The CTXA Hip Bone Mineral Densitometer 1s substantially equivalent to the listed predicate devices. The CTXA Hip in vitro and in vivo performance is comparable to that associated with the predicate devices.

778,K002620,2022-03-07,2,,"Vill. DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE: The OraMetrix SureSmile System is a complete image management system capable of acquisition, transmission, archive, display and print of patient images and demographic information. Its purpose 1s to facilitate these operations utilizing shared data to promote the availability of information locally, remotely, and at other facilities other than which it was acquired. The process begins by using the OraScanner to obtain a three-dimensional digital image of the dentition to provide the orthodontist a 3-D view of the teeth. These images may be integrated with other patient records to establish a three-dimensional treatment objective. This treatment objective is then used to design a custom appliance system, prescribed by the orthodontist, which is specific to each patient’s needs. Follow up scans using the OraScanner allow the orthodontist to precisely monitor patient progress through the entire treatment. | Systems are configured to meet the customer’s needs. Fully integrated systems could enable orthodontist to utilize speech recognition. IX. THE DEVICE The general hardware configuration of the systems may contain the following major components: Connectivity and comparability are evaluated and ensured via the integration test processes internal to OraMetrix, Inc. -SureSmile™ OraScanner -Monitors -Central Processing Units (CPU, memory, disks, microphone, speakers) -Film and Document scanners -Digital camera -CD-ROM writer / reader -Optical Disk Libraries -RAID array -DLT Tape Libraries | -9840 Tape Libraries -CD-R writer / reader : -DVD-R wniter/reader X. | INDICATION FOR USE The SureSmile™ System is used to provide a total orthodontic care solution to orthodontists with an _ image acquisition and viewing technology that delivers value throughout the entire care cycle; including record collection, treatment planning, treatment delivery, monitoring of care and patient communication. This treatment objective is then used to design a custom appliance system, prescribed by the orthodontist, which is specific to each patient’s needs. The result is a comprehensive care solution that addresses many problems that orthodontists face with patient care. The OraScanner is not intended for use as an operative device and is not manufactured to be sterile. 318"
779,K002620,2022-03-07,3,,"XI. SAFETY INFORMATION: . The System has limited patient contact and is utilized only by trained professionals. The scanner tips are removable to be sterilized between uses. The hand held unit has been designed to be wiped clean with commercially available disinfectant between uses. Additional trained professionals allowing sufficient review to afford identification and intervention in the event of a malfunction have evaluated the output of the device. Selection of the specific components of the system has been made to allow the system to remain cost effective and consistent with current technology through the substitution of components as technology develops. By retaining criteria for the substitution of components, any concerns about safety or efficacy and substantial equivalence can be satisfactorily met by a determination that the component substitution is not a significant change in the system. This is consistent with the existing Agency guidance. XI. CONCLUSION [21 CFR: 807.92(b)(3)] OraMetrix, Inc. believes sufficient information is included to reach a determination of substantial . equivalence. We conclude that the subject device is as safe and effective including the component and | accessory devices."

795,K002677,2022-03-07,3,,"510(k) Premarket Notification : NuVasive, Incorporated INS-1 Intraoperative Nerve Surveillance System | oe The device employs a ""Status"" routine to determine the baseline functional : status of exiting spinal nerves in the area of the operative target, and directs low amperage current through the distal tip of the NuVasive Expanding Cannula as it penetrates tissue to the operative target. Through a series of EMG electrodes placed on the muscle groups associated | with the spinal nerves at the operative level of the spine, the INS-/ System | | monitors EMG activity in these muscle groups and, when the Cannula tip | | | draws sufficiently near to one such nerve that the electrical energy it emits is strong enough to depolarize the nerve and create an EMG response, alerts the ) | surgeon that the Cannula tip is in proximity to that nerve. | An additional feature of the INS-1 System is a hand-held electrical probe | | _ which can assist the surgeon in determining if a nerve lies directly in the path of the instrumentation, and may also be used to ascertain whether a | | transpedicular screw has violated the pedicle wall. The JNS-1 System consists of a reusable Control Unit and PreAmp module, . and an assortment of disposable and reusable conductive probe cables, electrodes, and electrode leads. E. Intended Use | | | : The INS-1 Intraoperative Nerve Surveillance System is intended to provide Oo | | intraoperative electromyographic (EMG) surveillance to assist in the location a and evaluation of spinal nerves during percutaneous surgery of the spine, by | | | administration of low amperage electrical energy to tissues and nerves at the | operative site, and EMG monitoring of muscle groups associated with those | nerves. The INS-/ System is designed for use in conjunction with the | _ NuVasive Guided Spinal Arthroscopy System to assist in gaining controlled | percutaneous access to the spinal nerve root, foramina, intervertebral disc, and surrounding tissues of the spine via uniportal or biportal posterior or posterolateral approach, where anatomical restrictions safely permit. F. Comparison to Predicate Devices | The subject device has indications for use which are substantially equivalent | to those of one or more of the predicate devices, is composed of the same or _ | - equivalent materials as one or more commercially marketed devices, has the same design features as one or more of the predicate devices, and has | _ functional characteristics which are the same or equivalent to those of one or a more of the predicate devices. Due to the equivalency of indications for use, | | materials of composition, design features, method of use, and functional. _ characteristics, the device raises no new safety or effectiveness issues. aE | _ Page -72- ."

DiffMaster Octavia automatically locates and presents images of blood cells on peripheral blood specimens. The operator identifies and verifies the suggested classification of each cell according to type. DiffMaster Octavia is intended to be used by skilled operators, trained in the use of the instrument and in recognition of leukocyte classes. 5. Technological characteristics, comparison to predicate device Like the predicate device, the DiffMaster Octavia™ instrument locates WBCs, stores digital images of the cells and displays the images in an organized manner and suggests a cell class for each cell to aid technologists in performing the WBC differential procedure. A competent technologist is required to confirm or modify the suggested classification of each cell. It is intended to be used by skilled operators, trained in the use of the instrument and in recognition of leukocyte classes. Brief Discussion of Non clinical factors supporting a determination of substantial equivalence: The method involves a competent human observer to examine the microscopic images of the cells as does the predicate method and device. See attached substantial equivalence comparisons. Brief discussion of clinical tests supporting a determination of substantial equivalence: Two clinical trials have been performed to confirm equivalence with the predicate method Romanowski (MGG)-Stain manual light microscopic process for cell classification. The studies have been performed according to the approved standard, NCCLS, vol. 23, no 1, document H-20A, March 1992: Reference Leukocyte Differential Count (proportional) and Evaluation of Instrumental Method. Complementary nonclinical tests have been performed to confirm cell location and display of found cells. Conclusions drawn from clinical tests: The following information was obtained from the clinical tests comparing the DiffMaster Octavia™ cell classification results to the manual reference method results: e the accuracy of the suggested classification for each cell type (DiffMaster Octavia™ | results compared to the light microscope manual diff count results) e the precision for location and display of the cells found e the precision of the instrument (reproducibility) e the sensitivity and the specificity of the instrument (false positive and false negatives _ found) Results equal to the reference method was provided by use of the DiffMaster Octavia™ instrument. 7"

DESCRIPTION: Each implant consists of two telescoping end pieces and a locking ring. The plurality of holes and hollow core allow for the use of : grafting materials to help achieve solid fusion. To resist expulsion, | the implant endplates have teeth and small spikes to grip the endplates of the adjacent vertebrae. The implant can be expanded vertically using the self-locking ratchet | | mechanism. A shoulder on the inner telescoping piece will not pass | : through the locking ring, preventing over-expansion of the implant. The SynEx device is available in a variety of geometries and sizes. This enables the surgeon to choose the configuration suited to the individual pathology and anatomical condition. Only one SynEx ) device is to be implanted per spinal level. The interior of the spacer is open and can be packed with bone graft material. | The Synex Spacer implant is intended only for use with supplemental internal fixation. The supplemental internal fixation systems that may be used with the Synex™ Spacer implant include | | SYNTHES plate and rod systems (e.g., ATLP, VentroFix, USS). INTENDED USE: The SynEx™ Spacer is a vertebral body replacement device intended for use in the thoracolumbar spine (T1-L5) to replace a collapsed, } damaged, or unstable vertebral body due to tumor or trauma (i.e., fracture). The SynEx™ Spacer is intended to be used with Synthes supplemental internal fixation systems, e.g., ATLP, VentroFix and USS.

It is comprised of four principal components: the GuardWire Temporary Occlusion Catheter, the MicroSeal Adapter, the EZ Flator Inflation Device and the Export Aspiration Catheter. The GuardWire Plus System is a sterile, single use disposable device, packaged in a protective polyethylene tray covered by a polyethylene/Tyvek pouch. The pouch is then placed into a chipboard carton for protection during shipment. Both the pouch and the carton are labeled for easy product recognition. The GuardWire Plus System is available in the following configurations: Table 1: GuardWire Plus Configurations Number Diameter Length Range | The GuardWire Plus Temporary Occlusion Catheter is a 0.014” diameter guidewire available in lengths of 200 and 300 centimeters. The industry standard 0.014” diameter of this device allows for the delivery of a wide range of diagnostic and interventional devices over its shaft. The shaft is coated with Teflon to limit the frictional forces encountered when passing therapy devices over the wire. The distal end of the GuardWire contains an inflatable elastomeric balloon designed to occlude the target vessel during emboli-causing procedures such as stenting or angioplasty. The balloon is fully compliant and exerts less than two atmospheres of pressure on the target vessel during occlusion. The GuardWire’s occlusion balloon can accommodate vessel sizes ranging from 3mm to 6mm in diameter. The distal tip _ Of the wire is a shapeable radiopaque platinum coil similar to other standard guidewires. The GuardWire is used in conjunction with a removable adapter that assists in the inflation and deflation of the distal occlusion balloon. The MicroSeal Adapter provides a means for opening and closing the internal MicroSeal of the GuardWire which is a small valve intemal to the GuardWire Plus Temporary Occlusion Catheter. When the MicroSeal Adapter is in the “OPEN” position, the GuardWire internal seal is opened. This establishes fluid access to the occlusion balloon through the hollow Nitinol GuardWire shaft. When the MicroSeal Adapter is in the “CLOSE MICROSEAL” position, the MicroSeal of the GuardWire closes. This discontinues fluid access to the occlusion balloon. This allows the occlusion balloon of the GuardWire to remain inflated in the absence of direct communication with an inflation device.

This is achieved by means of a micro-seal plug located on the proximal end of the GuardWire Plus catheter. The MicroSeal plug consists of a stainless steel wire that is formed to provide friction in the hypo-tube with a sealing member on the distal end. The plug is pushed in and out, hence the sealing member moves distal and proximal to the inflation port, via the MicroSeal Adapter pads that grip the wire plug and are moved in conjunction with the Adapter knob. An inflation port is positioned on the hypotube to line up with the inflation port on the Adapter to provide a continuous fluid path to inflate the occlusion balloon. Fluid is transferred from the EZ Flator to the Adapter through the hypo-tube to fill the occlusion balloon. Fluid, i.c., diluted contrast, passes through the distal end and into the elastomeric occlusion balloon via the laser coil. EZ Flator Inflation Device The EZ Flator is a controlled volume syringe system contained in a single housing that enables the exact amount of diluted contrast to fill the occlusion balloon to the appropriate size. The fluid is pushed through the extension tubing via a steel plunger pin that is controlled by the inflation dial. Once the hypo-tube is prepped and the pin is pushed past the distal o-ring, a seal is formed in the extension line. The volume of the plunger pin in the inflation syringe barrel distal to the distal o-ring equates to the volume of the balloon. Therefore, inflation of the balloon is achieved by turning the dial, which pushes the plunger pin forward, to the appropriate volume indicated on the dial pad. The deflation syringe barrel is used for prepping the hypo-tube and deflating the occlusion balloon. A handle is attached to the plunger to provide a vacuum to the deflation syringe barrel. The deflation syringe barrel is used only when the inflation dial is in the “0” position, i.e., when the plunger pin is positioned proximal to the distal o-ring, as shown below, thereby opening the fluid path. In the drawing below the housing and plunger handle are not shown. Export Aspiration catheter The Export Aspiration catheter is a dual lumen catheter. The smaller of the lumens is the wire lumen used to run over the GuardWire. The size of the wire lumen is sized so that the Export catheter may run over the GuardWire smoothly. The larger sized lumen is the aspiration lumen. Via the 20cc syringe and one-way stopcock attached to the proximal end of the Export, blood and debris is evacuated from the graft and into the syringe.

Sunnyvale, California the Percutaneous Interventional Treatment of Saphenous Vein Bypass Grafts Premarket Notification [510(k)] Application March 29, 2001 MicroSeal Adapter The MicroSeal Adapter provides the mechanism to move the plug on the GuardWire catheter. Six grip pads are located on the Adapter, three on the upper half and three on the lower. Three wire clips are found on the lower half and are used for holding the wire firmly between the pads. The proximal pads are movable via the Adapter knob. The other four pads are immovable and are used to hold in place the GuardWire distal to the plug. Once the wire is placed in the Adapter and the knob is moved to the open position, the proximal pads slide, opening the plug. Diluted contrast flows through the Adapter via the inflation port. This port is sealed when the Adapter is closed and is lined up with the inflation port on the Guard Wire when placed in the Adapter.

Fluid Evacuation The objective of this study was to demonstrate that using the individual system components listed below, different types of fluids (i.e. saline, water, 40% glycerol / 60% saline) can be evacuated from a vessel at a minimum rate of 0.5ml/sec. In all cases, the GuardWire System Accessory Catheter and ancillary components were capable of evacuating all three types of fluids. In addition the flow rates obtained exceeded the minimum specification of 0.5ml/sec as established in conjunction with the PercuSurge Medical Advisory Board. Particle Evacuation The objective of this study was to demonstrate that the individual PercuSurge System components identified below could be used to evacuate particulates that were representative of the type of debris that may be found in blood following interventional procedures. It is concluded from this testing that the GuardWire System Accessory (Export) Catheter and ancillary components are capable of evacuating at least 90% of particles. This meets the evacuation capability requirement established by PercuSurge and in conjunction with the PercuSurge Medical Advisory Board. All components performed according to their individual specifications. Infusion Flow Rate The purpose of this qualification is to demonstrate that the 8F Export® Aspiration Catheter meets pre-determined specifications and test acceptance criteria after EtO sterilization. These fluids were selected to characterize the | Accessory Catheter infusion capabilities because they are fluids commonly infused in interventional applications. The testing conducted on the Export Aspiration Catheter demonstrates with the required statistical confidence that the current design meets all of the product specification requirements.

The conclusion from this analysis is that the occlusion balloon and blood removal by aspiration did not affect the vessel wall in the study cohort. Animal Studies The PercuSurge GuardWire System has been studied in 8 separate animal safety and effectiveness studies and in accordance with the Instructions For Use. These pilot studies confirmed the feasibility of this technology. The GuardWire System was compatible with the interventional devices with which it was tested and it successfully occluded the target vessel. It was capable of delivering fluid and evacuating blood. Flow was restored easily after the conclusion of each study. Further, the histopathology results showed that the use of the device had no significant adverse effects on the vessel in which it was used. Four additional animal comparative studies were performed to demonstrate the improvements and ease of use in the design modifications on the GuardWire system (GuardWire Plus design). These studies were primarily oriented towards performance evaluation and demonstrated that the modified design was superior based on | physician input. Additional Studies The first test entitled Particles in Motion Distal to the Therapy Balloon, was completed on 4/12/98 and addresses the question of whether particles would have a : tendency to aggregate along the proximal side of the distal occlusion balloon prior to aspiration and after therapy. The analyses and studies indicate that the use of a distal or proximal occlusive device does not have an effect of particle movement from therapy dilation. The particles from therapy dilation would not aggregate at the balloon proximal surface during deflation or removal of the therapy balloon. The presence of a distal occlusion balloon would not be expected to enhance particle adherence to a stent due to minor oscillation of the particles from heart rhythm.
